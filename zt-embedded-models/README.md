# üõ°Ô∏è Zero Trust Models for Embedded Systems

This directory explores how Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles can be adapted for embedded systems, especially in constrained or real-time environments.

Includes:
- Adapted ZTA models for microcontroller-based devices
- Access control and identity boundary mockups
- Micro-segmentation at the system level
- Policy enforcement component ideas

These models aim to bridge modern ZT principles with embedded development constraints.
