# 🔧 QuartzPhoenix's Secure Software Development Portfolio  
🛡️ **Secure Software Developer (Embedded-Focused)**  
🎯 Specializing in Embedded Security | Memory-Safe Systems | Secure Tooling for Mission-Critical Applications  

---

## 🧭 About This Portfolio  
This portfolio showcases my applied learning, research, and development work in secure software systems, with a strong foundation in embedded firmware and growing capabilities in secure systems programming and DevSecOps tooling. My focus is on building security into the core of mission-critical, resource-constrained systems while also exploring adjacent areas like CI/CD security automation, SBOM integrity, and memory-safe application design.

Projects and materials align with security frameworks such as NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 1/2, SP 800-53, and secure software practices including SLSA, OpenSSF, and OWASP SAMM. You’ll find architecture artifacts, secure firmware code in C/C++ and Rust, tooling demonstrations, and Zero Trust-aligned security models.

## 🔬 In Development

I'm currently expanding into secure software tooling and DevSecOps practices, including:

- Static analysis rule writing (C/C++, AST)
- Secure CLI tooling in Rust
- SBOM generator and validator
- Secure Linux daemon sandboxing

These projects will be added to the `secure-software-projects` section over time.
