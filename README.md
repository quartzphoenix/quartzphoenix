# üß¨ QuartzPhoenix's Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis Portfolio  
üß† **Reverse Engineering Specialist | Malware Analyst | Threat Tooling Researcher**  
üéØ Specializing in Static/Dynamic Malware Analysis | Reverse Engineering Automation | National Defense-Aligned Threat Research  

---

## üß≠ About This Portfolio  
This portfolio documents my technical transition from compliance-based roles into the deep technical domain of reverse engineering and malware analysis. It showcases my development through graduate research, hands-on tooling, CTF participation, and open-source contributions. My work is focused on analyzing evasive binaries, building malware detection capabilities, and automating reverse engineering workflows to defend mission-critical systems.

All projects align with real-world malware challenges and national cyber defense objectives. You'll find dynamic/static analysis case studies, custom tooling in Python, YARA rule development, and documentation of CTF and research work intended to support my MSCS in Cyber Operations and future PhD goals.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer  
All samples, scripts, and analysis in this portfolio are for **educational and research purposes only**. No real-world malware is executed outside controlled, isolated lab environments. All malware samples are sourced from public repositories like ANY.RUN, MalwareBazaar, or CTF challenges. This work is non-operational and does not represent real systems.
