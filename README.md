## 🧭 About This Portfolio

This portfolio documents my technical exploration and continuous learning in secure system architecture, risk-aligned compliance, and Zero Trust design.  
It includes architecture artifacts, RMF-aligned frameworks, and personal research projects using public standards such as NIST SP 800-53, SP 800-207, and SP 800-160.
