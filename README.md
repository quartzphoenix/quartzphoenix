# 🔧 QuartzPhoenix's Secure Embedded Systems Portfolio  
🛡️ **Secure Embedded Systems Developer**  
🎯 Specializing in Secure Firmware Design | Embedded System Hardening | Mission-Critical Software Security  

---

## 🧭 About This Portfolio  
This portfolio showcases my applied learning, research, and development work in secure embedded systems. With a foundation in cybersecurity and a growing specialization in embedded firmware and system-level software security, my focus is on building security into the core of mission-critical, resource-constrained systems.

Projects and materials here align with public security frameworks such as NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 1/2, NIST SP 800-53, and relevant secure software practices. The content includes embedded systems architecture artifacts, secure coding demos in C/C++, firmware lifecycle documentation, and conceptual models grounded in Zero Trust principles and system assurance.
