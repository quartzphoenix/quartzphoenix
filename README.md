## 🧭 About This Portfolio

Welcome to the personal research and development lab of **QuartzPhoenix**, a cybersecurity professional and reverse engineer specializing in:

- 🧬 **Embedded Firmware Security**
- 🔎 **Malware and Threat Analysis**
- 🛡️ **Cyber-Physical System (CPS) Resilience** *(focused on national defense platforms such as missile systems and flight control subsystems)*
- 📚 **Secure Boot and Binary Trust Chains**

This space supports my academic work at Dakota State University (MSCS Cyber Operations → PhD), professional projects, and long-term goal of strengthening **mission-critical CPS** through binary assurance, tooling, and education.

## 🔧 Current Focus

🛰️ **Reverse Engineering ARM-Based Firmware**  
Detecting implants, backdoors, and vulnerabilities in embedded firmware found in **avionics, missile guidance systems, and sensor fusion platforms**.

🧪 **Firmware Emulation and Validation**  
Using QEMU, FirmAE, and custom analysis pipelines to model real-world behaviors and test **firmware trustworthiness in defense-focused CPS**.

🛠️ **Tool Development**  
Building lightweight scripts and frameworks for unpacking, analyzing, and validating firmware binaries—especially at **boot, initialization, and trust boundaries**.

🧬 **Resilience Research**  
Studying recovery, failover, and integrity assurance in **embedded systems controlling weapons platforms, aircraft systems, and guided munitions.**
