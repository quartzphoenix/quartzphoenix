# 👋 Welcome

**Hi, I’m QuartzPhoenix** — a second-career cybersecurity professional exploring the technical depths of **reverse engineering** and **low-level software analysis**.

I bring a mission-aligned mindset to security, combining a foundation in compliance and risk with a growing focus on binary analysis, system internals, and software behavior.

## 🔍 What I’m Working On

- 🧠 Building technical depth in **reverse engineering** with tools like Ghidra, Cutter, and Radare2  
- 🔐 Studying **malware behavior**, **binary unpacking**, and **dynamic analysis**  
- ⚙️ Learning from real-world samples in a **controlled lab** environment using **FlareVM**  
- 📚 Documenting my journey with hands-on notes, lab walkthroughs, and tool setup guides
