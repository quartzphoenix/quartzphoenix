# ðŸ”’ Firmware Security Lab

This directory includes hands-on experiments and secure coding demos focused on embedded firmware development.

Planned content:
- Memory-safe C and C++ examples
- Buffer overflow and stack protection experiments
- Compiler hardening flag tests (`-fstack-protector`, `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, etc.)
- Static/dynamic analysis tool outputs (e.g., cppcheck, Valgrind)

This space is for practicing, testing, and validating secure firmware concepts.
